# Computer Science Icons Quiz

Ada Lovelace wrote a computer program before there were computers. Alan Turing struggled with bigotry even after saving millions of lives as a WWII codebreaker. Learn all this and more in my extraordinary Computer Science Icons Quiz!

## Technologies

This website was built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Users do not need setup.

## Mockup

The following image shows the website is action!

## Resources-used

* <a href="http://www.asmarterwaytolearn.com/js/index-of-exercises.html" target="_blank"> I referenced Mary Myers' book "A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript" more than once. Specifically, the chapters on "The DOM".</a> 

* <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank"> I didn't have much experience using setInterval so I consulted "Eloquent JavaScript", pages 248 and 341, for examples.</a> 

* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Boyd_Granville" target="_blank"> I used Wikipedia for the facts about Ada Lovelace, Alan Turing, John Von Neumann, Margaret Hamilton, and Evelyn Boyd Granville. </a> 

* <a href="https://github.com/AmyShafer/watch-and-code" target="_blank"> I looked at some old code I worked on for the online class "Watch and Code" while I struggled to add new information to the quiz in the different stages. </a> 

* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLtAMg9_Svw" target="_blank_"> I got stuck on subtracting from the timer as a penalty but I found a video from The Coding Train that was insightful. </a> 


## Possible-improvements

Presently, the application does not save more than one player on the "High Scores" board. A neat improvement would be to have more high scorers featured. 

Another fun addition would be to provide the player with a way to learn the correct answers to the questions they did not know. The quiz could either tell the player outright or supply a type of study guide after scoring so the user could reach the information afterwards.
