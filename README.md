## Resources-used

* <a href="http://www.asmarterwaytolearn.com/js/index-of-exercises.html" target="_blank"> I referenced Mary Myers' book "A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript" more than once. Specifically, the chapters on "The DOM".</a> 

* <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank"> I didn't have much experience using setTimeout so I consulted "Eloquent JavaScript", pages 249 and 377, for examples.</a> 

* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Boyd_Granville" target="_blank"> I used Wikipedia for the facts about Ada Lovelace, Alan Turing, John Von Neumann, Margaret Hamilton, and Evelyn Boyd Granville. </a> 

* <a href="---" target="_blank"> I looked at some old code I worked on for the online class "Watch and Code" while I struggled to add new information to the quiz in the different stages. </a>
